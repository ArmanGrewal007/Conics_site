# Conics_site

This is just a basic website which shows applications of conic sections, mostly using HTML, because when I made it I didn't knew much about CSS

There are some [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/ "Geogebra site") applets which help in visualizing some of the applications

I also had some 3D applets, but they were making the website very slow to load. I tried adding buttons to toggle between showing them and hiding them, but still the issue persisted, so in this website only 2D applets are there.

*Psst!* initially I though about making an interactive website for [Quadratic Surfaces](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticSurface.html), but it was pretty tedious and also I didn't know about the optimization methods for websites. So I chose [Conic Sections](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConicSection.html), as they are 2D projections of Quadratic Surfaces.
